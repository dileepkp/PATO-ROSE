How to compile/run the benchmark suite:

Each benchmark support different input data sizes, called class S, W, A, B, or C. S is the smallest test size. 

1. check/modify config/make.def to have the correct compiler and options

  Some predefined examples are available, like make.def.rose.omp (enable OpenMP) or make.def.rose-seq (sequential mode)

2.  make suite # compile all benchmarks
   Optionally modify the default size for each benchmark  when "make suite"  in config/suite.def

3. Alternatively you can compile a single benchmark with a specified data size, like
  make bt CLASS=A

binary executables are saved into bin/ directory
