# PATO - Program Analysis Through Ontology

A brief description of the PATO project is
[here](https://github.com/yzhao30/PATO-Pointer-Analysis).
This repository is based on the ROSE compiler.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Follow the instruction [1][1] and [2][2] to install EDG 4.x-based ROSE.
2. Edit `set.rose` to set the correct PATH to your install and run `. set.rose`.
3. `$ cd tools/onto-build-rose/` and run `make`

### Directory Structure

+ ontology/ - The owl files defining the used concepts (vocabularies, relations, etc)
are put here. This is the core ontology and can be regarded as the meta-model for the
program. It is not the generated ontology from programs.
+ projects/ - It contains separate analysis projects. Currently they are prototyped
with Prolog to implement different program analysis over the generated ontology of
program. There are "canonical loop analysis" and "control flow graph"(CFG) analysis.
+ test/ - Some benchmarks for testing.
+ tools/onto-build-rose - It includes the frontend to build the knowledge from program, i.e., the ontology
generator. It's a parser for C program built on ROSE compiler. If you want to extend
the parser to cover more language features or structures, you can start with
`rosePrgKnowledgeBuilder.h/cpp`. It essentially implements an AST traversal to extract
information from the program. The `OntoGeneratorInterface.hpp` defines some interfaces
for generating different format of the ontology (owl, ttl, pl).

### Usage

1. Generate knowledge base from program, represented as ontology or linked data

		$ rosePrgKnowledgeBuilder.exe -c -w -emit-owl out.owl input.c [-I/extra-include-dir]

2. Run a program analysis based on logic inference (as Prolog script)

	Canonical Loop

		$ swipl --nosignal --quiet projects/canonicalloop/run.pl out.owl report.txt

	or CFG

		$ swipl --nosignal --quiet projects/cfg/run.pl out.owl report.txt

Another sub-project implementing the pointer analysis is in
 [repository](https://github.com/yzhao30/PATO-Pointer-Analysis). If you are interested in
 extending the project, that one is recommended. We shift the C program parser to
 more popular Clang.
